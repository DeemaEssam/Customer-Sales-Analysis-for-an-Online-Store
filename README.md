# Customer-Sales-Analysis-for-an-Online-Store

I developed an analytical report consisting of multiple dashboards, each tailored to address specific business questions and enable data-driven decision-making.

🔹 Dashboard 1 – Customer Analysis
To understand customer behavior, their distribution by gender and location, and their spending value.

🔹 Dashboard 2 – Sales Analysis
To analyze sales performance, identify top-performing categories and products, and assess the impact of discounts on overall performance.

🔹 Dashboard 3 – Time Series Analysis
To analyze sales trends over time, identify seasonal patterns, and support forecasting of future sales.
